# EternalResourceExtractor

![Build Status](https://github.com/PowerBall253/EternalResourceExtractor/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Small C++ utility to extract files from a DOOM Eternal .resources or .wad7 file.

## Features

* Supports launching from command line with arguments, double clicking on it, and dragging and dropping.
* ~2-3x faster than QuickBMS on extracting files.
* Standalone, does not require any additional files.
* Lighter than QuickBMS and other extraction tools.
* Supports Windows and Linux.

## Usage

The syntax for the CMD is:

```
EternalResourceExtractor.exe [path to .resources/.wad7 file] [out path] [options]
```

The supported options are:

* `-h`, `--help`: Displays the help message and exits.
* `-q`, `--quiet`: Silences output during the extraction process.
* `-f`, `--filter=FILTERS`: Indicates a pattern the filename must match to be extracted,  using `*` for matching various characters and `?` to match exactly one. You can also prepend a `!` at the beginning of a filter to indicate it must not be matched, and separate various filters with a `;`.
* `-r`, `--regex=REGEXES`: Similar to `-f`, but allows full ECMAScript-style regular expressions to be passed.

You can also double click on it or drag and drop the .resources file to get started.

## Compiling

The project uses CMake to compile. It also needs MSVC or the MinGW toolchain on MSYS to compile on Windows.

First clone the repo by running:

```
git clone https://github.com/PowerBall253/EternalResourceExtractor.git
```

Then, generate the makefile by running:

```
cmake -B "build" # Append "-G 'MSYS Makefiles'" on MSYS
```

Afterwards you can build with:

```
cmake --build "build" --config Release
```

Finally, on Linux you can run

```
strip "build/EternalResourceExtractor"
```

to reduce the binary's filesize.

The EternalResourceExtractor executable will be in the `build` folder in Linux/MinGW and in the `build\Release` folder in MSVC.
